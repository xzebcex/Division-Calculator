# Division Calculator
This is a simple Python script that allows users to enter two numbers and divide them to find their quotient. It is intended to be run through the command-line interface.

## Getting Started
To run this script, you must have Python installed on your computer.

# Usage
1.	Launch the command-line interface (e.g. Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows).
2.	Go to the directory containing the division_calculator.py file.
3.	Execute the script by running python division calculator.py and clicking the Enter key.
4.	Enter two integers to be split and follow the on-screen directions.
Note: To exit the script, type 'q' and hit Enter at any time.

## How it works
The script used a while loop to repeatedly request the user for two integers to divide until the user presses the 'q' key to exit. If a legitimate pair of integers is given by the user, the script employs a try/except block to catch any potential ZeroDivisionError (i.e. the second number entered is zero). If no errors are reported, the script divides the first and second numbers and prints the quotient to the console.
